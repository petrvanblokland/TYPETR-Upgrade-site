<h2>Repeat to improve</h2>
<p>What makes a design process fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time. It’s not a linear process, it’s an iterative process, which means repeating the previous step in more detail.</p>

<h2><em>Design Design Space</em></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p><em>Design Design Space</em> is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your way of presentating. In short, a space where you can design your design process. </p>
<p>What kind of challenges do you experience in your daily work as a designer?</p>
<p>Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of other students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>By definition designers are bad planners. It seems to be fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning – “There is still plenty of time”, a design is never finished – “The next one will always be better”. </p>
<p>However, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline may have a much larger impact on the quality of the result, than the personal opinion of the designer.</p>
<p>How do you make this apparent conflict work to your advantage?</p>
<h3>How much time do you need?</h3>
<p>The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you do it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (research – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. </p>
<p>Of course, it does matters how long you study something, for the level of details that can be addressed. But if you only have a day or a week for an assignment, then that is part of the requirements. The result can still be better than anything your customer would have done. </p>
<p>How would you design such a design process better next time?</p>
<h3>1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 season • 1 year</h3>
<p>Study lengths range from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 season and possibly 1 year, whatever fits best to your plans, your practical possibilities and your financial situation.</p>
<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 day $150 (<a href="game.html">Design Game</a>, group of minimal 12)</li>
<li><a href="projects.html#oneWeek">1 week</a> $900 (7 days, group of 4 or more)</li>
<li><a href="projects.html#oneMonth">1 month</a> $1,900 (calendar month, individual or group)</li>
<li><a href="projects.html#oneSeason">1 season</a> $3,900 (3 calendar months, individual or group)</li>
<li><a href="projects.html#oneYear">1 year</a> $7,900 (individual or group)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prices are per person. Discount or split payment for the month, season and year trainings can be discussed, depending on your personal situation.</p>
<p>For corporate trainings, groups or customized requests, please <a href="mailto:info@designdesign.space?subject=Tell me more about Design Design Space">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Students who whish to extend one training level into another, a 50% reduction is applied on previous payed tuition. E.g 1 day followed by 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $900 = $975. Or 1 week followed by 1 month: 1/2 $900 + $1,900 = $2,350. Or 1 week followed by 1 season: 1/2 $900 + $3,900 = $4,350</p>
<h3>What is the schedule &amp; how to submit?</h3>
<p>Every 6 months, in March and September, a new day-week-month-season-year sequence starts, most likely if there is enough participating students. </p>
<p>Day-week sequences or single day Design Games can take place on other dates during the year, if the amount of participants makes it possible.</p>
<p>Since working as a team of students a minimum amount of three is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation and experience. </p>
<p>Season and year-students are admitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. Also they are asked to write a motivation and development plan.</p>
<p>Students that finish a training adequately, automatically get accepted for a next.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p><em>Design Design Space</em> taps into 35 years of studio projects and over 50 years of combined experience of design education. Projects ranging from corporate identities, type design, typographic software, interiors, environmental design and running Design Games.</p>
<p><img alt="DSGNWK_0582BWLow.jpg" src="docs/images/DSGNWK_0582BWLow.jpg" /><br />
<em>Design Game on location at <a href="https://www.otis.edu" target="External">OTIS College of Art and Design</a>.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals.</p>
<p>For interaction and exchanging documents a range of techniques are available, e.g. Skype, Google Hangout, Google Docs, offline video, Dropbox, Github, FaceTime and Second Life, to name a few. Selection and usage can be the topic of one of the assignments.</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Students get assignments for imaginary design projects, with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, where the specific topics can be filled by the individual students.</p>
<p>Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired, what techniques and materials need to be developed and how the project planning should be designed, are all part of assignments. </p>
<p>With regular intervals – ranging from hours to days to once per week – the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. The aim of the coaches is to create a safe environment, in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.</p>
<h3>Safe environment</h3>
<p>The process of creating such a safe environment – and the finding of methods for feedback – are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.</p>
<p>During the presentations feedback is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between the presentations. </p>

<em>Various models are offered to students, showing what their design process could be like. And they are encouraged to created their own, and apply them to their designs.</em></p>
<h3>Design methods</h3>
<p>In the past a magnitude of design methods have been developed, but unfortunately most of them focus on production techniques and deadlines.<br />
You may recognize that in your current design practice.</p>
<p>What most design methods don’t do is create space for designers to develop themselves. To allow unintended mistakes. Cuddle solutions that don’t seem to be profitable right away. To spend time on acquiring skills without predefined purpose.</p>
<p>Yet, for the development of skills, such an approach is essential. </p>
<p><em>Design Design Space</em> offers that environment. To study a specific topic for a defined period of time. Formulating challenges, feed back techniques and design methods that are customized for your development.</p>
<h3>Tuition</h3>
<p>Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. <br />
No refund is possible, but participants have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. </p>

<h2>Online Design Game</h2>
<h3>Duration 8 hours</h3>
<p>For those who ever did a Design Game on location, you’ll recognize the idea behind it. Doing one online, however, will be a new experience.</p>
<p>For those who never did a Design Game, this is a good way to start thinking about your design profession in a totally different way. </p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>The time frame of an online Design Game, depends on the time zones of the participants. We’ll try to make it as convenient as possible, yet it could be that yours starts at early dawn or late evening. Isn’t that just like working for international customers, expecting you to work on flexible parts of the day?</p>
<p>Virtual studios are formed from three or more designers. Since you are likely not in the same physical place or time zone, it is part of the game to find a way of working together. Improvisation is a form of design.<br />
As studio you may want to consider dividing tasks depending on experience and interests.</p>
<p>Design Design Space is a transparant learning environment, where the online Design Game is the most condensed example.</p>
<p>There will be several studios working in a pitch for the same assignment for the same customer. At the end of each round the design get approval points.</p>
<p>The aim is that the best performing studio after 4 rounds wins the game.</p>
<p>In each round a new assignment is given, where the formation of the studios stays the same. This way experience on what went right or wrong in the previous rounds can be used to improve the next result.</p>
<h3>Round 1: Corporate Identity</h3>
<p>The first round takes 2 hours to design and present a corporate identity. Details and requirements are given at the start of each round. </p>
<p>Studios have the possibility to present to their customer through digital media, e.g. by e-mail and hangout, asking questions, showing intermediate sketches.</p>
<p>At the end of each round, the final design of every studio is presented to their customers and the other studios. The customers will judge the process and the result and give feedback.</p>
<p>Scores of each round are visible to the group in an online document.</p>
<h3>Round 2: Another Corporate Identity</h3>
<p>The second round is similar to the first round – a new corporate identity, different requirements for another customer – but in shorter amount of time.</p>
<h3>Round 3: Magazine</h3>
<p>Design and present different types of pages of a magazine. The challenge with working in an virtual environment, is to divide the work between the designers of the studio. What visual parameters define the difference between the types of pages and which parameters make the visual coherence?</p>
<h3>Round 4: Exhibition</h3>
<p>Design and present an exhibition space, that fits the given requirements. With photos and video a physical scale model is presented to the customer and the other studios.</p>
<p>In this round all studios will judge and comment the result of all other studios. That feedback is used as part of the final score.</p>
<h3>Presentations and feedback</h3>
<p>In a presentation where are designs can be compared, a winner is selected. </p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Concluding the 1 day of Design Design Space, feedback is given to the studios and individual designers. What went well? What were challenges? </p>
<h4>Trained skills</h4>
<p>During the Design Game, several design skills are addressed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing, time management, asking interventions</li>
<li>Management of detail levels</li>
<li>Development of sketching techniques</li>
<li>Communication between designers in a virtual studio</li>
<li>Asking the right questions to the customer</li>
<li>Selection of presentation media</li>
<li>Judging and formulating feedback to other studios</li>
</ul>
<p>Participating in the Design Game is mandatory for the extending studies at Design Design Space. From here students can choose to apply for one of the 1 week, 1 month, 1 season or 1 year extended programs.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>Below some example assignments.</p>
<h3>Design of methods for selection and feedback</h3>
<p>3 posters, similar and different in one series, for a topic of your choice. Assignemnt is how to judge the result and how to select from various judging methods.<br />
*How to develop criteria </p>
<h3>Basic skills</h3>
<p>Painting of color/gray ranges. Sketching with materials, proportions, ratio and contrast.</p>
<p>Although much of your work may have digital outcome, actually making stuff with real materials opens up new directions, other points of view.</p>
<h3>Sketching techniques</h3>
<p>One week to fill a 100 page Moleskine sketchbook, design for a specific subject, context or design challenge.<br />

<h3>Petr van Blokland</h3>
<p>Petr van Blokland (1956, Netherlands) graduated cum laude from the graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1980.</p>
<p>With his partner Claudia Mens, Van Blokland worked for over thirty-five years as a designer in the studio they cofounded. His output ranged from sketching and model-making to programming in various languages. He specialized in systematic design: corporate identities, form systems, online publications, and tools for type design.</p>
<p>Van Blokland has taught graphic design, typography, and type design for many years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem. His first typeface was Proforma, a large series commissioned by Purup, a Danish manufacturer of form-preparation systems. Proforma has now been released for general use through Type Network. In 1988, Van Blokland’s work brought him ATypI’s coveted Charles Peignot Prize.</p>
<p>As cofounder and partner of Type Network, Van Blokland is a dedicated contributor and developer of new type and tools for type design.
