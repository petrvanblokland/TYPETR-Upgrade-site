													<h2>Upgrade styles and axes</h2>
													<span class="byline">Supporting a variety of related styles</span>
												</header>
												<p>[Explaining the workings of interpolation, multiple master axes and variable fonts. There is a number of slides of previous presentations that can be used as illustrations here.]</p>
												<img src="images/NoordzijCube-test-x-1000MMTranspUpgrade.gif" alt="NoordzijCube-test-x-1000MMTranspUpgrade.gif" width="100%"/>
												<p><a href="https://typetr.typenetwork.com/news/article/The-Gerrit-Noordzij-Cube">Gerrit Noordzij’s cube</a> is based on a merger of expansion contrast (sharp-nib pencil) and translation contrast (broad-nib pencil). The type of contrast used in Upgrade is based on translation, with little difference between vertical thick and horizontal thin strokes. The animation (based on software by Just van Rossum’s <a href="http://dailydrawbot.tumblr.com" target="external">Daily Drawbot</a>) shows where the contrast principle of Upgrade is located in Noordzij’s cube.</p>
												<p>Upgrade styles shown in this example are Light, Book, Regular, Semibold, and Black.</p>   

												<h3>Different drawings for different weights</h3>
												<img src="images/glyphsbyweights.png" alt="glyphsbyweights.png" width="100%"/>
												<p>Depending on the available space of stems and counters in the various weights, some characters have different drawings. There is no room for the vertical bar in the dollar and cent symbols to strike completely through. Note that although all weights are shown here (ranging from Hairline to UltraBlack), details in the extreme weights may not make them ideal candidates for use in this size.</p>

												<h3>More variations to come in the near future</h3>
												<p>Soon more variations in the Upgrade family—like Upgrade Condensed, Upgrade Wide, and Upgrade Text—will be released. And these variants will be combined, together with other parametric axes, in Upgrade Var. These are all intended to increase typographic quality for specific usage and size.</p>

												<h3>Alternative styles, using the Upgrade family as a template</h3>
												<p>Also planned is a number of variants that cannot easily be expressed in the interpolating axes needed for variable fonts. These variants have a more stylistic approach based on specific usage, where readability is not the first priority. Some projected example names of these non-variable families include Upgrade Round, Upgrade Notouch, Upgrade Logo, Upgrade Ink, and Upgrade Metal.</p>

														<h2>Axis examples</h2>
													</header>
													<ul class="style1 posts">
														<li>
															<h3>Weight (wght)</h3>
															<p>The default weight axis of Upgrade is made from five masters, to cover the extreme range between Upgrade Hairline and Upgrade UltraBlack.
															<a href="documents/stackedTypePages.pdf" target="external"><img src="images/stackedTypePages.gif" class="spreadPageLeft" width="100%"></a>
															Click on the animation to view a similar document as a <span class="c2sc">PDF</span>.</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<h3>How this animation was made</h3>
															<p>This eight-frame animated GIF was made by <a href="scripts/stackedWords.py">this PageBot script</a>, which works as follows: <br><br>

															<span class="c2sc">[1]</span> Start a script in <em>DrawBot + PageBot</em> that takes a random selection from a list of words and then combines them in pairs. Each pair will fill a line.<br> 
															<span class="c2sc">[2]</span> If the number of characters in a line is fewer than twelve—or otherwise with a chance of ten percent—convert the line to capitals.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[3]</span> The stack of lines starts at the top of a page: put the cursor at the top left corner of the margin.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[4]</span> Select a random weight from the TYPETR Upgrade family. There is a twenty percent chance that italics are selected.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[5]</span> Then calculate the point size needed, to make the line fit the document page width.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[6]</span> Calculate the enclosing pixel box and move the cursor position vertical to the next line, increased by some leading.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[7]</span> Repeat this until the page is filled.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[8]</span> Then repeat this page sequence for the required number of frames in the animation.<br>
															<span class="c2sc">[9]</span> Save as a <span class="c2sc">PDF</span> and as an animated GIF, with a frame duration of three seconds.<br>
															</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<h3>Baseline J [ss08] feature</h3>
															<p>Special note that the capital lines use the OT-feature [ss08], which forces Upgrade to use the inline <b>J</b> instead of the standard hanging <b>J</b>. This creates a closely wrapped bounding box on capital words.</p>

														<h2>Design workshops</h2>

													<ul class="style1 tweets">
														<li>
															<p>Are you looking for a course to improve your type-design skills? Or simply one to learn how to script boring production tasks? That is possible. See for instance:</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<h3>Programming typography (Oct 1-8, 2018)</h3>
															In this intensive weeklong online workshop, you will select a typographic project and then ask yourself how the design and production could have been automated, using your own scripts. And how many more alternatives you could have visualized. <a href="http://designdesign.space/#programming-typography" target="External">Read more...</a></p>
														
															<p>Or, if you have more time and want to dive deeper into the subject of typographic algorithms, consider applying for this monthlong course:</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<h3>Python scripting for graphic designers (May 7–June 4, 2018)</h3>
															<p>A group of graphic designers learn how to script micro and macro tasks from scratch in their design process. In a series of short, specific assignments, the designers learn to recognize patterns that can be automated, breaking them down into functions that can be coded. <a href="http://designdesign.space/#python-scripting-for-graphic-designers" target="External">Read more...</a></p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>Generally speaking, <a href="http://designdesign.space" target="external">Design Design Space</a> encourages students to study the design of their process, independent of context, domain, or purpose of the designs.</p>
