													<h2>Upgrade typography</h2>
													<span class="byline">A work-horse sans, with character.</span>
												</header>
												<p>Upgrade is TYPETR’s new sans, designed for a wide range of publication types and media, by supporting a large set of characters and features.<br>
												(... some more here?)
											    </p>

												<h3>Acknowledged</h3>
												As always, designing a large family like can this – writing a novel – can never be done without the support and input from a great team, in order of appearance: Claudia Mens, Tilmann Hielscher, Jill Pichotta, CJ Dunn, David Jonathan Ross, Marina Chaccur, Tamye Riggs, Yves Peters, Claire Lindsey, Caren Litherland, Paley Dreier and the rest of the Type Network production and marketing teams.<br>
												Not to forget the supplyers of tools Frederik Berlaen, Erik van Blokland, Just van Rossum and Michiel Kauw-A-Tjoe.<br>
												And last but not least my partners in Type Network and more, David Berlow, Sam Berlow and Roger Black.</p>

												<h3>This site</h3>
												<p>This website gives an overview of what TYPETR Upgrade is capable of doing and background information about its design and production.<br>
												Futhermore, the website contains a variety of example publication, where most of the can be viewed in detailed PDF, by clicking on the thumbnails.<p>

												<p>Most examples in this site are created by scripts. That may not be in the direct line of interest for every designer, it is TYPETR’s believe that the development of typefaces and publications changed fundamentally in the past few years. Not only the increase in size (800+ glyphs, 8000+ kerning pairs, interpolating weights and widths) but also the construction of the new Variable Fonts and the creation of documents by parameters and data, rather than manual page-layout, make new views on typograpghy and graphic design necessary.<br>

												<h3>Upgrade design study</h3>
												It is beyond the scope of this website to discuss all of this in detail. And it is just as well possible to buy a single license of Upgrade for usage 
												Yet TYPETR thinks it is relevant to mention that much of the Upgrade functionality is very much prepared for scripted types of publications, such as online and automated PDF documents.</p>

												<p>Together with <a href="http://designdesign.space" target="External">Design Design Space</a> designer can study the development of their design process using scripting and other prototyping and production techniques. TYPETR Upgrade is an excellent example of how automation can address the functions in a typeface more easily than doing it entirely manual. For designers taking an Upgrade license, the scripts for the images on this website are available. And in reverse, designers doing a study or workshop at Design Design Space, some special free Upgrade styles are included.<br>

												Troughout this website, references will show relevant studies and workshops, that support the use of Upgrade in scripted publications. With the near future release of Upgrade Var – a 10-axis Variable Font – this development will get even more important.</p>

												<h3>Upgrade variations for all types of usage</h3>
												<p>The wide viariety of weights, in combination with the additional styles to be released in the near future (e.g. Upgrade Text, Upgrade Round and Upgrade Var), makes the Upgrade family a perfect choice for corporate publications. These need to be represented in print and online documents, supporting the wide range of typographic functions in many sizes. <a href="usage.html">Learn&nbsp;more</a></p>

													<h3>Upgrade Var</h3>
													<p>In line of the new font technology “Variable Fonts”, Upgrade Var is under development with parametric interpolation axes XTRA, XOPQ, RNDS, GRAD, YTLC, YTUC, YTDE and registered axes wght and wdth.<br>
													This new technology combines all Upgrade weights (and more) in a single font file, so all intermediate weights and widths can be selected too. The practical usage is that headlines can be made to fit a defined width and a given point size.<br>
													If this sounds too technical for you, expect to see more visual support here soon.<br>
