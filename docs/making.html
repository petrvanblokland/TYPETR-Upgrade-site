													<h2>The making of Upgrade</h2>
													<span class="byline">Some design notes</span>
												</header>
												<p>TYPETR Upgrade was made with <a href="http://doc.robofont.com" target="External">RoboFont</a>, the type-design tool developed by Frederik Berlaen. The application is entirely written in Python, which allows designers to “hack in” at any level of their tools.</p>
												<p>RoboFont runs on top of a number of other code libraries, such as Tal Leming’s Vanilla and Defcon, Just van Rossum’s FontTools (now fully supported and maintained by Google), Adobe’s FDK, and Erik van Blokland’s “MutatorMath”, to name a few.</p>
												<p>The community of professional type designers is relatively small, and its tasks are so diverse, that any comparison to applications like PhotoShop and InDesign fails. For the most part, type designers need to create their own tools to support the design and production of their typefaces. Any existing, canned solution is likely to be used by graphic designers, too. They don’t need type designers for that.</p>

												<h3>Scripting</h3>
												<p>The same applies to the development of TYPETR Upgrade. Almost all design and production work was done with Robofont, but over fifty different scripts were used to accomplish specific tasks, such as the automatic creation of characters, testing tension in curvature, testing symmetrical spacing, testing the compatibility of similar shapes, creating proof specimens, automatic kerning where possible, and interpolation and conversion to various output formats.</p>
												<p>The main reason for developing scripts during the design process is to create short production cycles, so that one can easily test the final result at any stage of the process. Otherwise, wrong guesses can eat up a lot of valuable time.</p>

												<img src="images/upgradeeditwindow.png" alt="" width="100%"/>	
												<figcaption>The main EditWindow in RoboFont looks like this. A single letter (Semibold glyph) is shown as an outline, with markers on the position of the points drawn by the designer. Also visible in this window is the addition of a set of Type Network tools that draw the blue accent cloud, the analyzed metrics of the drawing, and some other weights (Hairline and Light) in the background as comparison.</figcaption>
												</figure>

												<img src="images/upgradehairline.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
												<figcaption>The Type Network application TextCenter—running within RoboFont—is used to finalize the side bearings of all glyphs, while the can be viewed in the context of a page. Upgrade Hairline’s spacing is shown here.</figcaption> 
												<figure>
												<img src="images/upgradehairlinekerning.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
												<figcaption>Subsequently, kerning is applied. The most important glyph pairs (or groups of glyphs that have a similar shape on the side) can have their own correction value in addition to the spacing. Kerning values can be positive and negative.</figcaption>
												</figure>
												<figure>
												<img src="images/upgradekerning.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
												<figcaption>Here, the spacing process is shown for the Upgrade Semibold style; some pairs, such as <b>To</b>, always need negative kerning. The <b>o</b> moves partly under the roof of the <b>T</b>.</figcaption>

														<li>
															<p>Do you want to learn how to design and produce typefaces like Upgrade, directly from the makers? That is possible. <a href="http://designdesign.space" target="external">Design Design Space</a> offers a flexible choice of courses and workshops, where participants can define their individual goals.</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>Or, if you want to learn how to make Python PageBot scripts (like the ones that created the images on this website), let us know you are interested. Together we can probably find an appropriate strategy for such a course of study.</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>More generally, <a href="http://designdesign.space" target="external">Design Design Space</a> encourages students to study the design of their process, independent of context, domain, or purpose of the designs.</p>
