<h3>What is the time frame?</h3>
<p>There are several options, ranging from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, all offering the same process. The difference is the level of details, development of skill and amount of specialization in specific topcis.</p>
<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
<p>There are 4 possible training levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 day $150</li>
<li>1 week $800 (7 days)</li>
<li>1 month $2000 (calendar month)</li>
<li>1 year $6000</li>
</ul>
<p>For students who whish to extend one time frame into another, the payed amount will be deducted by 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 day extending into 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $800 = $875</li>
<li>1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400</li>
<li>1 day extending into 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400</li>
<li>1 month extending into one year: 1/2 $2000 + $6000 = $7000</li>
<li>1 week extending into 1 month extending into 1 year: 1/2 $2400 + $6000 = $7200</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. <br />
No refunding is possible, but students have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. <br />
In exceptional situations payment in portions can be discussed.</p>
<h3>What is the schedule &amp; how to submit?</h3>
<p>Every 3 months a new day-week-month-year sequence starts, under the condition that there are at least 3 students. </p>
<p>The coaches have the right to decide postponing the start of a new sequence, if not enough students submitted and group them together.</p>
<p>Since working as a team of students a minimum amount is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. </p>
<p>Students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. They have to write a motivation and development plan, which will be presented in a Google Hangout.<br />
If there is enough time between submission and the start of a new sequence, students can get some initial assignment to work on without coaching. <br />
The volume this depends on the length of the of the training that students apply for.</p>
<p>Students finishing one training level adequately, automatically get admitions for a next level.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals.</li>
<li>Students get assignments for design projects with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, for which specific topics can be filled by the individual students.</li>
<li>Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired and what techniques/materials need to be developed and how to design the planning for the project, are all part of the assignment. </li>
<li>With regular intervals (ranging from hours to weeks) the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. It is the aim of the coaches to create a safe environment in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.</li>
<li>The process of creating such a safe environment and the methods for feed-back themselves are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.</li>
<li>In the presentations feed-back is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between presentations. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Biggest advantage of this activity for us</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not bound to any accreditation or institution</li>
<li>No startup cost</li>
<li>Highly scalable in volume of students</li>
<li>Highly scalable in contributing teachers</li>
<li>Very flexible in focus, content and directions</li>
<li>Works anywhere, anytime, any language, country and culture, as long as people get online.</li>
<li>Large “touch base” of students who already have similar experience in our regular lessons</li>
<li>A lot of this we already have available as assignments, examples, etc.</li>
<li>Flexible in pricing for special cases.</li>
<li>Focus is on design students, not on buildings, organizations and degrees.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The design process</h3>
<p>The idea behind the training is that every design process can be divided into three phases: research, design and presentation.<br />
As e.g. the research phase by definition has design and presentation aspects (answering questions such as “How am I going to do the research” and “How am I going to present the research results?”), every phase has this division in three, making a recursive structure.<br />
Of course the required time and level of details are subject of choice, but that itself is a design question to be answered.</p>
<h3>Personal design space</h3>
<p>An important aspect of every design project is that it is a journey, a travel, with some definition of starting point, some definition of the target, but – by definition – an undefined path from one to the other. Otherwise that path would have been called a production process.</p>
<p>From the personal experience for the designer, such a journey has always had conditions that must be filled for success.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling; dreams, plans, goals and knowing yourself</li>
<li>Fellowship; the social fabric, the environment of the designer</li>
<li>Dragon; where you stumble, the treasure lies</li>
<li>Performance; stepping into the middle of the moment </li>
<li>Return; bringing home the Holy Grail</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specialization topics</h3>
<p>In all of the four time frames of a sequence (day, week, month, year) students can select a combination of specializations (where this selection process also is part of the design skills to be developed).<br />
The difference between the time frames is the level of details and the amount of skill training. For the rest each phase in the process is a recursive copy of itself.</p>
<p>The combination of any 2 or 3 topics from the list below gives each students a unique personal research environment to develop.</p>
<h4>Topics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Type design</li>
<li>Design for fashion</li>
<li>Design of information visualization</li>
<li>Interior and exhibition design</li>
<li>Design for multiple media from single source</li>
<li>Parametric design, programming and coding</li>
<li>Corporate design</li>
</ul>
<h4>Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Design of research methods</li>
<li>Sketching techniques</li>
<li>Design the design process</li>
<li>Presentation techniques</li>
<li>Design of feedback and evaluation techniques</li>
<li>Design of testing methods</li>
</ul>
